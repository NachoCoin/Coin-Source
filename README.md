# Intro

NachoCoin is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with the goal of
providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.

Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, PPCoin and NovaCoin, innovations such as
proof-of-stake help further advance the field of crypto-currency.
